Button_Previous=<<  Previous  <<
Confirm_LockConfig=Are you sure you want to close the configuration?
Confirm_SkipGuide=Are you sure you want to skip the configuration guide?
Confirm_UploadConfig=Are you sure you wish to overwrite the current running configuration with the selected file?
Confirm_SSLDisable=Are you sure you wish to use a non-secure connection?  Many directories will not allow password operations over non-secure connections.
Display_ConfigEditorLocales=<p>Edit the display fields presented to users. Whenever a single value is modified for a setting, all values for that setting will be used to override all default locale-specific values for that particular setting. Display keys not modified from the default will use the default display value of the current defaults.</p>
Display_ConfigGuideNotSecureLDAP=Your LDAP server connection is not configured to be secure.  If you wish to secure the connection between this system and your LDAP server, return to the previous page and enable secure connections.  Keep in mind that some functionality may not be available with a non-secure connection.
Display_ConfigGuideSelectTemplate=<p>Begin your configuration by selecting a default template below.  If you decide to change your selection later, you can choose a different template at any time.</p>Setting the template does not directly control where user responses can be stored or what directory type is used, it merely helps set the correct default values for settings to reasonable values.</p><p>For example, user responses answers can be stored in the embedded LocalDB, remote Database, or LDAP.  Selecting a template that "stores responses in Database" only sets the default values for the response storage location to Database, you can still change the setting to any desired location.</p>
