CATEGORY_LABEL_GENERAL=General Settings
CATEGORY_DESCR_GENERAL=

LABEL_title=Application Title
DEFLT_title=Password Self Service
DESCR_title=Name of the application, shows up on the default html header.

LABEL_logoutURL=Logout URL
DEFLT_logoutURL=
DESCR_logoutURL=URL to redirect user to upon logout.  If the site is being accessed through an\
 web authentication gateway, the logout URL should be set to the gateway's logout URL.  For example:\
 <ul><li>Novell iChain: <i>/cmd/ICSLogout</i></li>\
 <li>Novell Access Manager: <i>/AGLogout</i></li></ul>\
 If you are using a gateway and do not include the proper logout page here, then users will\
 almost certainly get authentication errors, intruder lockouts and other problems.  If it's working\
 properly then the user should see the gateway logout screen when they logout of PWM.\
 <p/>\
 This url can be set to any desired relative or absolute URL.  At the time the user's\
 browser requests this url, the PWM session will have already been invalidated.\
 <p/>\
 This setting can always be overridden for any given user session by adding a <i>logoutURL</i>\
 parameter to any HTTP request during the session.\

LABEL_forwardURL=Forward URL
DEFLT_forwardURL=/pwm
DESCR_forwardURL=After completing operations which do not require a logout, the user will be forwarded to this url.\
 <p/>\
 This setting can always be overridden for any given user session by adding a <i>forwardURL</i>\
 parameter to any HTTP request.

LABEL_logoutAfterPasswordChange=Logout After Password Change
DEFLT_logoutAfterPasswordChange=true
DESCR_logoutAfterPasswordChange=Force user to logout of PWM (and send to logoutURL) after a password change.\
 <p/>\
 In most cases, this should be left on (default), true, especially if using\
 a web access gateway.  However, some scenarios require that the user is not immediately\
 logged out.\

LABEL_servletRelativeURL=Servlet URL
DEFLT_servletRelativeURL=/pwm
DESCR_servletRelativeURL=The path to the servlet's own context.  In most cases this should never be changed.

LABEL_smtpServerAddress=Email SMTP Server Address
DEFLT_smtpServerAddress=smtp.example.com
DESCR_smtpServerAddress=Any emails generated by PWM will be sent via this URL.\
 Removing this setting will prevent PWM from sending any email at all.\
 Be sure the server listed here allows relaying.  The default server will not work!  For\
 best results, use a local smtp server.\

LABEL_useXForwardedForHeader=Use X-Forwarded-For Header
DEFLT_useXForwardedForHeader=true
DESCR_useXForwardedForHeader=If present, use the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header value as the client IP address instead of\
 the source IP address of the connection.

LABEL_adminAlertEmailAddress=Admin Alert To Address
DEFLT_adminAlertEmailAddress
DESCR_adminAlertEmailAddress=During certain events, PWM will send email notifications\
 such events include things like intruder lockout events, or ldap server unavailability\
 Leave this setting blank to disable the alerts.\

LABEL_adminAlertFromAddress=Admin Alert From Address
DEFLT_adminAlertFromAddress=PWM Alert Notification <noreply@example.com>
DESCR_adminAlertFromAddress=Admin alert "From" email address.

LABEL_expirePreTime=Password Pre-Expire Time
DEFLT_expirePreTime=86400
DESCR_expirePreTime=Number of seconds before a user's password expires in which to force the user to change\
 their password.  If the user's password will expire within this time frame, PWM will behave\
 as if the user's password has already expired.\
 <p/>\
 Setting this value to a day or so will prevent most cases of a user's password expiring\
 while they are logged in.  The recommend setting for this value is 86400.\
 <p/>\
 <pre>86400 = 1 day</pre>

LABEL_expireWarnTime=Password ExpireWarn Time
DEFLT_expireWarnTime=432000
DESCR_expireWarnTime=Number of seconds before a user's password expires in which to warn the user to change\
 their password.  If the user's password will expire within this time frame, PWM will warn\
 the user during a CommandServlet checkExpire or checkAll operation.\
 <p/>\
 If this time is zero or less than the expirePreTime, this feature will be disabled.\
 <p/>\
 <pre>432000 = 5 days</pre>

LABEL_expireCheckDuringAuth=Check Expire During Authentication
DEFLT_expireCheckDuringAuth=true
DESCR_expireCheckDuringAuth=When the user is authenticated to PWM, should there be a check to see if the user's\
 password is expired (or about to expire based on the expirePreTime).  If this is set to\
 true, and the user's password is expired, they will be forced to the expire password page.\

LABEL_externalPasswordMethods=External Password Methods
DEFLT_externalPasswordMethods=
DESCR_externalPasswordMethods=A comma separated list of java methods to call after a successful password change.  These\
 methods may take such actions as updating passwords in other systems or updating\
 eDirectory.  The full package name must be included.\
 <p/>\
 Unless your adding custom java code to PWM, you should leave this blank.

LABEL_passwordSyncMaxWaitTime=Password Sync Wait Time
DEFLT_passwordSyncMaxWaitTime=90
DESCR_passwordSyncMaxWaitTime=During a password change, PWM will wait for the password to be synchronized to all\
 configured servers.  In cases where the synchronization may take an extraordinary amount of\
 time, this setting will prevent the page from timing out.  Note that this functionality\
 requires the pwmSchema.ldif be applied first.\
 <p/>\
 Value is measured in seconds.

LABEL_password.WordlistFile=Wordlist File
DEFLT_password.WordlistFile=wordlist.zip
DESCR_password.WordlistFile=PWM supports full dictionary checking to prevent users from using commonly used words as\
 passwords.   The default wordlist contains commonly used English passwords.  A more\
 comprehensive wordlist is available on the PWM project page.  Additionally, a custom\
 wordlist can be used.  Wordlists with over 10 million words have been tested.\
 <p/>\
 The first time PWM is run with a new wordlist setting, it will take awhile to compile\
 the wordlist into a database.  See the status screen/logs for progress information.\
 The wordlist format is one or more text files containing a single word per line, enclosed\
 in a ZIP file.\
 <p/>\
 Setting this to blank will disable wordlist (dictionary) checking.\

LABEL_password.SeedlistFile=Seedlist File
DEFLT_password.SeedlistFile=seedlist.zip
DESCR_password.SeedlistFile=PWM can generate "freindly" random password suggestions to users.  It does this by using\
 a "seed" word or words, and then modifying that word randomly until it is suffeciently\
 complex and meets the configured rules computed for the user.\
 <p/>\
 Setting this to blank will result in suggested passwords being completely randomized.\

LABEL_command.checkResponses.queryMatch=Check Responses Query Match
DEFLT_command.checkResponses.queryMatch=(objectClass=*)
DESCR_command.checkResponses.queryMatch=if the command servlet is called with the checkIfResponseConfigNeeded command:\
 <p/>\
 <i>/pwm/private/CommandServlet?command=checkIfResponseConfigNeeded</i>\
 <p/>\
 the user is first checked to see if they match the following LDAP query before the\
 user's password responses is checked.  If the user does not match this query, then the\
 user's responses will not be checked, and the user will be redirected to the forward URL.\

LABEL_passwordLastUpdateAttribute=Last Password Update Attribute
DEFLT_passwordLastUpdateAttribute=pwmLastPwdUpdate
DESCR_passwordLastUpdateAttribute=This attribute is used to mark when the password is updated, and is used during\
 replication checks, and other processes.\

LABEL_password.sharedHistory.age=Shared History Age
DEFLT_password.sharedHistory.age=2419200
DESCR_password.sharedHistory.age=After a user password change, PWM will store a user's old password in the shared history\
 list.  The shared history list will then be used during new password creations, and users\
 will not be permitted to use a password stored there.  Passwords are stored as salted\
 hashes in the pwmDB.\
 <p/>\
 This has the effect of producing a common, shared password history for all PWM users.  Old\
 passwords are added to the history at the time of password change.\
 <p/>\
 Passwords are stored as a salted hash.\
 <p/>\
 Setting this to zero will disable the shared history.\
 <p/>\
 PWM will periodically remove values older than the configured value here.  Value is\
 specified in seconds.  Default is 4 weeks (60s * 60m * 24h * 7d * 4w = 2419200)\

LABEL_ldapServerURLs=LDAP URLs
DEFLT_ldapServerURLs=ldaps://127.0.0.1:636
DESCR_ldapServerURLs=List of ldap servers in URL format.  Comma separated.\
 These servers are used in order of appearance in this list.  If the first server\
 is unavailable PWM will use the next available server in the list.  PWM will\
 then periodically fail back to the first server to see if it has become available.\
 <ul><li>For plain-text servers, use "<i>ldap://serverame:389</i>" format</li>\
 <li>For SSL, use the "<i>ldaps://servername:636</i>" format</ul></li>\
 <p/>\
 Note also that for SSL connections, the Java virtual machine running PWM must trust the directory server,\
 either because it has a valid commercial certificate, or because you have\
 manually added the public key certificate from the tree to the java keystore.\
 <p/>\
 For Novell eDirectory, see Novell TID Document 10072075 for an overview of the certificate export/import process.

LABEL_ldapProxyDN=LDAP Proxy User
DEFLT_ldapProxyDN=cn=admin,o=system
DESCR_ldapProxyDN=LDAP DN of user with rights to all users to be managed, in LDAP typeful syntax.\
 This user must have rights to browse users, and manage password attributes on\
 the user object.\
 <p>\
 PWM uses this proxy user to perform operations against the directory.\
 <p>\
 Generally, the proxy user needs read/browse object rights to all user objects\
 it will manage, as well as create object rights in the new user container (if\
 enabled).\
 <p>\
 the following attribute rights are required:\
 <p>\
 <ul><li>compare/read attribute rights to all attributes</li>\
 <li>Write attribute rights to the following:</li>\

LABEL_ldapProxyPassword=LDAP Proxy User Password
DEFLT_ldapProxyPassword=password
DESCR_ldapProxyPassword=The corresponding password of LDAP Proxy User DN user.

LABEL_ldapPromiscuousSSL=LDAP Promiscuous SSL
DEFLT_ldapPromiscuousSSL=false
DESCR_ldapPromiscuousSSL=If true PWM will trust any SSL certificate without any verfication.  WARNING: using \
  promiscuous SSL is a security risk and should never be used in a production deployment.\

LABEL_loginContexts=Login Contexts
DEFLT_loginContexts=
DESCR_loginContexts=If configured, this setting will add another field to the form-based PWM\
 login screen.  The field will allow the user to select a specific context\
 used during login.  This allows PWM to be used against trees that do not\
 have unique usernames throughout.\
 </p>\
 Values are separated with three semi-colons ";;;".  Values can further be set\
 with both a display value and a context, separated by three colons ":::".\
 </p>\
 For example:\
 </p>\
 <pre>ou=sf,ou=ca,o=org:::San Francisco;;ou=lon,ou=uk,o=org:::London</pre>\
 </p>\
 Any contexts here must be below the context specified in the\
 ldapContextlessLoginRoot setting.

LABEL_ldapTimeout=Ldap Timeout
DEFLT_ldapTimeout=10000
DESCR_ldapTimeout=Timeout for ldap connections (in milliseconds).  If an LDAP server does not respond\
 to a request within this time period it will be considered a failed server.

LABEL_ldapContextlessLoginRoot=LDAP Contextless Login Root
DEFLT_ldapContextlessLoginRoot=ou=users,o=utopia
DESCR_ldapContextlessLoginRoot=Base context to search for usernames during login

LABEL_pwmAdmin.queryMatch=PWM Admin Query String
DEFLT_pwmAdmin.queryMatch=(description=PWMADMIN)
DESCR_pwmAdmin.queryMatch=Query string used to detect if a user is a pwmAdministrator.  An LDAP query is performed\
 during pwm login against the logged in user to determine if the user is a pwm Admin.  If\
 the user matches the query, then the user is considered a PWM administrator.\
LABEL_usernameSearchFilter=Username Search Filter

LABEL_usernameSearchFilter=Username search filter
DEFLT_usernameSearchFilter=(&(objectClass=person)(cn=%USERNAME%))
DESCR_usernameSearchFilter=Used to for contextless login and other functions to find\
 users in ldap using usernames.  The literal value <i>%USERNAME%</i> is replaced with the\
 actual username value.

LABEL_autoAddObjectClasses=Auto Add Object Classes
DEFLT_autoAddObjectClasses=pwmUser
DESCR_autoAddObjectClasses=Object classes to automatically add to users who authenticate to the password\
 servlet.  Typically this is the standard pwmUser aux class.  The definition for this\
 class is in the supplied pwmSchema.ldif file.

#*******************************************************************************************#
CATEGORY_LABEL_EDIRECTORY=eDirectory Settings
CATEGORY_DESCR_EDIRECTORY=These settings are only used when Novell eDirectory is the ldap\
 directory service being used.\

LABEL_ldap.edirectory.enableNmas=Enable NMAS Extensions
DEFLT_ldap.edirectory.enableNmas=true
DESCR_ldap.edirectory.enableNmas=When connecting to a Novell eDirectory ldap directory, this parameter will control if PWM\
 will use NMAS extensions when connecting to the ldap directory.  Enabling nmas results in:\
 <ul><li>better error messages when using unversal password policies</li>\
 <li>better error handling during certain change password scenarios</li></ul>\
 Unless you are using an older version of eDirectory (pre 8.8 or before), it is generally\
 best to set this to true.\
 <p/>\
 All NMAS operations require an SSL connection to the directory.

LABEL_ldap.edirectory.alwaysUseProxy=Always use proxy
DEFLT_ldap.edirectory.alwaysUseProxy=false
DESCR_ldap.edirectory.alwaysUseProxy=Always use proxy user account for ldap connections.  If true, PWM will only ever bind to\
 the LDAP directory using the proxy username and password.  When set to true:\
 <ul><li>Authentication will be performed using ldap compare operation instead of bind</li>\
 <li>All read/write operations will require permission of the proxy user</li>\
 <li>Security is managed exclusively by PWM, any defects or "security holes" in pwm would\
 result in an exploitable security breach</li>\
 <li>Password change operations are performed using the proxy user connection</li>\
 <li>User grace logins will not be decremented</li></ul>\
 The default setting is false.  You should carefully consider the security impacts before setting this to true.

LABEL_ldap.edirectory.readPasswordPolicies=Read Password Policies
DEFLT_ldap.edirectory.readPasswordPolicies=true
DESCR_ldap.edirectory.readPasswordPolicies=If this setting is true, PWM will attempt to read the eDirectory password policy settings\
 for the user.  If a universal password policy is configured and enabled, that policy will\
 be read.  In cases where there is a conflict between the PWM configuration and eDirectory,\
 the most restrictive policy will be used.\

LABEL_password.allowChange.queryMatch=Change Password Query Match
DEFLT_password.allowChange.queryMatch=(objectClass=*)
DESCR_password.allowChange.queryMatch=Query string used to detect if a user is a permitted to change password.  The user must be\
 returned during this is ldap query or else the user will not be permitted to change the password.

#*******************************************************************************************#
CATEGORY_LABEL_INTRUDER=Intruder Detection
CATEGORY_DESCR_INTRUDER=PWM has built in intruder detection independent of what eDirectory itself\
 provides.  Because PWM may be exposed directly to the internet, this additional\
 layer of detection safeguards against direct attacks.  PWM will always deny a\
 password based authentication if eDirectory's intruder detection is evaded.\
 <p/>\
 PWM's own intruder detection mechanisms are only stored in memory, and are not resetable,\
 thus, the timeouts should be relatively short.  The goal for PWM intruder detection isn't\
 to watch for human intruders, it is designed to stop robot or automatic attacks.\

LABEL_intruder.user.resetTime=User Reset Time
DEFLT_intruder.user.resetTime=300
DESCR_intruder.user.resetTime=This setting defines the time period after which a bad attempt will be cleared from\
 the lockout table.  The user lockout table is marked for a user anytime a user has\
 a failed attempt to authenticate, recover a password, or activate a user account.\
 <p/>\
 Value is in number of seconds.  A value of zero disables the user lockout table.\

LABEL_intruder.user.maxAttempts=User Maximum Attempts
DEFLT_intruder.user.maxAttempts=10
DESCR_intruder.user.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts a user may make within the reset time interval.  Once\
 this value is exceeded, the user will not be able to perform any PWM activities until\
 the reset time interval has passed.

LABEL_intruder.address.resetTime=Address Reset Time
DEFLT_intruder.address.resetTime=120
DESCR_intruder.address.resetTime=This setting defines the time period after which a bad attempt will be cleared from\
 the lockout table.  The address lockout table is marked for any source ip address\
 anytime any user has a failed attempt to authenticate, recover a password, or activate\
 a user account from that address.\
 <p/>\
 Depending on how PWM is deployed it may not be able to correctly identify the IP address\
 of the user.  You can check if it is getting the correct IP address by looking at\
 the light text on the bottom of every screen, or by looking at the PWM logs.\
 <p/>\
 Some scenarios where PWM would not get the correct address is where it is behind\
 a reverse proxy that doesn't set the X-Forwarded-For header, or behind some types\
 of NAT firewalls.\
 <p/>\
 Value is in number of seconds.  A value of zero disables the address lockout table.\

LABEL_intruder.address.maxAttempts=Address Maximum Attempts
DEFLT_intruder.address.maxAttempts=30
DESCR_intruder.address.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts any user may make within a particular address.  Once\
 this value is exceeded, no user from that address will be able to perform any PWM\
 activities until the reset time interval has passed.\

LABEL_intruder.session.maxAttempts=Session Maximum Attempts
DEFLT_intruder.session.maxAttempts=5
DESCR_intruder.session.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts any user may make during a particular browser session.\
 Once this limit is exceeded, it will never reset.  Opening a new browser or waiting for\
 the session idle timeout will get the new user a new session, however.\

LABEL_eventLog.localDbMaxEvents=Maximum pwmDB Events
DEFLT_eventLog.localDbMaxEvents=1000000
DESCR_eventLog.localDbMaxEvents= Maximum log events stored in pwmDB.  PWM will retain this number of events in the local\
 pwmDB database and use these to display in the admin event log screen.\
 <p/>\
 This setting does not effect the normal log files configured in log4jconfig.xml or\
 tomcat's log file settings.\

 Approximately 100MB of disk space will be consumed for each 100,000 log events.

LABEL_eventLog.localDbMaxAge=Maximum Age pwmDB Events
DEFLT_eventLog.localDbMaxAge=2419200
DESCR_eventLog.localDbMaxAge=Maximum age of events stored in pwmDB.  PWM will evict events older than this from the\
 pwmDB database.  This setting is related to "eventLog.localDbMaxEvents".  Events will be\
 evicted by whichever condition occurs first.\
 <p/>\
 This setting does not effect the normal log files configured in log4jconfig.xml or\

 <p/>\
 PWM will periodically remove values older than the configured value here.  Value is\
 specified in seconds.  Default is 4 weeks (60s * 60m * 24h * 7d * 4w = 2419200).  A value\
 of zero will cause PWM to not remove events due to age.\

LABEL_eventLog.userAttribute=User History Attribute
DEFLT_eventLog.userAttribute=pwmEventLog
DESCR_eventLog.userAttribute=Attribute used to write a user event log.  The user event log attribute will\

 paramater with a key of "skipCaptcha".   This is useful for "internal" clients / links where the captcha is unneccessary.\
 <p/>\
 For example, if the value is 'okay', a request to:\
 <p/>\

 successful captcha check.\

 of pwm (see web.xml instanceID setting) will be used.  If set to any other value, then\
