CATEGORY_LABEL_GENERAL=General Settings
CATEGORY_DESCR_GENERAL=

LABEL_pwm.applicationTitle=Application Title
DEFLT_pwm.applicationTitle=Password Self Service
DESCR_pwm.applicationTitle=Name of the application, displayed in the header on each page.

LABEL_pwm.forwardURL=Forward URL
DEFLT_pwm.forwardURL=/pwm
DESCR_pwm.forwardURL=After completing any activity which does not require a logout, the user will be forwarded to this url.\
 <p/>\
 This setting can always be overridden for any given user session by adding a <i>forwardURL</i> \
 parameter to any HTTP request.

LABEL_pwm.logoutURL=Logout URL
DEFLT_pwm.logoutURL=
DESCR_pwm.logoutURL=URL to redirect user to upon logout.  If the site is being accessed through a \
 web authentication gateway, the Logout URL should be set to the gateway's Logout URL. \
 If you are using a gateway and do not include the proper Logout URL here, then users will \
 almost certainly get authentication errors, intruder lockouts and other problems.  If things are working \
 properly then the user should see the gateway logout screen when logging out of PWM.\
 <p/>\
 The Logout URL can be set to any desired relative or absolute URL.  At the time the user's \
 browser requests this url, the PWM session will have already been invalidated.\
 <p/>\
 This setting can always be overridden for any given user session by adding a <i>logoutURL</i> \
 parameter to any HTTP request during the session.

LABEL_logoutAfterPasswordChange=Logout After Password Change
DEFLT_logoutAfterPasswordChange=true
DESCR_logoutAfterPasswordChange=Force user to logout of PWM (and send to logoutURL) after a password change.\
 <p/>\
 In most cases, this should be left on (default), especially if using \
 a web access gateway. 

LABEL_expirePreTime=Password Pre-Expire Time
DEFLT_expirePreTime=86400
DESCR_expirePreTime=Number of seconds before a user's password expires in which to force the user to change \
 their password.  If the user's password will expire within this time frame, PWM will behave \
 as if the user's password has already expired. \
 <p/> \
 Setting this value to a day or so will prevent most cases of a user's password expiring \
 while they are logged in.  The recommend setting for this value is 86400 (1 day).

LABEL_expireWarnTime=Password ExpireWarn Time
DEFLT_expireWarnTime=432000
DESCR_expireWarnTime=Number of seconds before a user's password expires in which to warn the user to change \
 their password.  If the user's password will expire within this time frame, PWM will warn \
 the user during a CommandServlet checkExpire or checkAll operation. \
 <p/>\
 If this time is zero or less than the expirePreTime, this feature will be disabled.  The recommended \
  setting for this value is 432000 (5 days).

LABEL_expireCheckDuringAuth=Check Expire During Authentication
DEFLT_expireCheckDuringAuth=true
DESCR_expireCheckDuringAuth=When the user is authenticated to PWM, should there be a check to see if the user's \
 password is expired (or about to expire based on the expirePreTime).  If this is set to \
 true, and the user's password is expired, they will be forced to the expire password page. \

LABEL_passwordSyncMinWaitTime=Password Change Minimum Wait Time
DEFLT_passwordSyncMinWaitTime=5
DESCR_passwordSyncMinWaitTime=During a password change, PWM will wait for at least this amount of time before forwarding \
  the user. \
  <p/>\
  Value is specified in seconds.

LABEL_passwordSyncMaxWaitTime=Password Change Maximum Wait Time
DEFLT_passwordSyncMaxWaitTime=90
DESCR_passwordSyncMaxWaitTime=During a password change, PWM will wait for the password to be synchronized to all \
  configured LDAP servers.  In cases where the synchronization may take an extraordinary amount of \
  time, this setting will prevent the page from timing out.\
  <p/>\
  Value is specified in seconds.

LABEL_pwm.wordlist.location=Wordlist File
DEFLT_pwm.wordlist.location=wordlist.zip
DESCR_pwm.wordlist.location=PWM supports worldlist dictionary checking to prevent users from using commonly used words as \
 passwords.   Using wordists is an important part of password security.  Wordlists are used by intruders to guess common \
 passwords.   The default wordlist included with PWM contains commonly used English passwords.  More \
 comprehensive wordlists are available on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pwm">PWM project</a> page.  \
 Wordlists with over 10 million words have been tested. \
 <p/> \
 The first time PWM is run with a new wordlist setting, it will take some time to compile \
 the wordlist into a database.  See the status screen/logs for progress information. \
 The wordlist format is one or more text files containing a single word per line, enclosed \
 in a ZIP file.  The String <i>!#comment:</i> at the beginning of a line indicates a comment.

LABEL_pwm.seedlist.location=Seedlist File
DEFLT_pwm.seedlist.location=seedlist.zip
DESCR_pwm.seedlist.location=PWM can generate "friendly" random password suggestions to users.  It does this by using \
 a "seed" word or words, and then modifying that word randomly until it is sufficiently \
 complex and meets the configured rules computed for the user.\
 <p/>\
 Setting this to blank will result in suggested passwords being completely randomized.\

LABEL_password.sharedHistory.age=Shared History Age
DEFLT_password.sharedHistory.age=2419200
DESCR_password.sharedHistory.age=After a user password change, PWM will store a user's old password in the shared history \
 list.  The shared history list will then be used during new password creations, and users \
 will not be permitted to use a password stored there.  Passwords are stored as salted \
 hashes in the pwmDB.\
 <p/>\
 This has the effect of producing a common, shared password history for all PWM users.  Old \
 passwords are added to the history at the time of password change.\
 <p/>\
 Passwords are stored as a salted hash. \
 <p/>\
 Setting this to zero will disable the shared history. \
 <p/>\
 PWM will periodically remove values older than the configured value here.  Value is \
 specified in seconds.  Default is 4 weeks (60s * 60m * 24h * 7d * 4w = 2419200)\

LABEL_google.analytics.tracker=Google Analytics Code
DEFLT_google.analytics.tracker=
DESCR_google.analytics.tracker=Google tracking cookie code.  Used for Google Analytics.  See <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">\
  http://www.google.com/analytics/</a>.  If this setting is blank, this feature will be disabled.

DESCR_ldap.serverUrls=List of ldap servers in URL format.  PWM will use thse servers in a \
 fail-over mode.  The servers are used in order of appearance in this list.  If the first server \
 is unavailable PWM will use the next available server in the list.  PWM will \
 then periodically fail back to the first server to see if it has become available.\
 <ul><li>For plain-text servers, use "<i>ldap://serverame:389</i>" format</li>\
 <li>For SSL, use the "<i>ldaps://servername:636</i>" format</ul></li>\
 <p/>\
 Note also that for SSL connections, the Java virtual machine running PWM must trust the directory server, \
 either because it has a valid commercial certificate, or because you have \
 manually added the public key certificate from the tree to the Java keystore.

 This user must have rights to browse users, and manage password attributes on \
 the user object.\
  <p/>\
  Any valid string the ldap directory will accept during a BIND operation is valid.  For most directories \
  this will be a DN (distinguished name) in a format similar to <i>cn=admin,o=example</i>.  For Active Directory \
  this can be in the format of <i>admin@example.org</i>.\
 <p/>\
 Generally, the proxy user needs read/browse object rights to all user objects \
 it will manage, as well as create object rights in the new user container (if \

DESCR_ldap.rootContexts=Base context to search for usernames during login

LABEL_ldap.selectableContexts=Login Contexts
DEFLT_ldap.selectableContexts=
DESCR_ldap.selectableContexts=If configured, this setting will add another field to the form-based PWM \
 login screen.  The field will allow the user to select a specific context \
 used during login.  This allows PWM to be used against trees that do not \
 have unique usernames throughout.\
 <p/>\
 Values can further be set with both a display value and a context, separated by three colons "::".\
 <p/>\
 For example:\
 <p/>\
  <b>ou=sf,ou=ca,o=example::San Francisco</b>\
  <br/>\

DEFLT_pwmAdmin.queryMatch=(groupMembership=cn=PwmAdmins,ou=Groups,o=example)
DESCR_pwmAdmin.queryMatch=Query string used to detect if a user is a pwmAdministrator.  An LDAP query is performed \
 during pwm login against the logged in user to determine if the user is a pwm Admin.  If \
 the user matches the query, then the user is considered a PWM administrator.

LABEL_ldap.usernameSearchFilter=Username search filter
DEFLT_ldap.usernameSearchFilter=(&(objectClass=person)(cn=%USERNAME%))

 <ul><li>better error messages when using unversal password policies</li>\
 <li>better error handling during certain change password scenarios</li></ul>\
 Unless you are using an older version of eDirectory (pre 8.8 or before), it is generally \
 best to set this to true.\
 <p/>\
 All NMAS operations require an SSL connection to the directory.

LABEL_ldap.edirectory.alwaysUseProxy=Always use proxy
DEFLT_ldap.edirectory.alwaysUseProxy=false
DESCR_ldap.edirectory.alwaysUseProxy=Always use proxy user account for ldap connections.  If true, PWM will only ever bind to \
 the LDAP directory using the proxy username and password.  When set to true: \
 <ul><li>Authentication will be performed using ldap compare operation instead of bind</li>\
 <li>All read/write operations will require permission of the proxy user</li>\
 <li>Security is managed exclusively by PWM, any defects or "security holes" in pwm would \
 result in an exploitable security breach</li>\
 <li>Password change operations are performed using the proxy user connection</li>\
 <li>User grace logins will not be decremented</li></ul>\
 The default setting is false.  You should carefully consider the security impacts before setting this to true.

LABEL_ldap.edirectory.readPasswordPolicies=Read Password Policies
DEFLT_ldap.edirectory.readPasswordPolicies=true
DESCR_ldap.edirectory.readPasswordPolicies=If this setting is true, PWM will attempt to read the eDirectory password policy settings \
 for the user.  If a universal password policy is configured and enabled, that policy will \
 be read.  In cases where there is a conflict between the PWM configuration and eDirectory,  \
 the most restrictive policy will be used.\

LABEL_ldap.edirectory.readChallengeSets=Read Challenge Sets
DEFLT_ldap.edirectory.readChallengeSets=true
DESCR_ldap.edirectory.readChallengeSets=If true, PWM will read the challenge set configuration from eDirectory and apply it to \
users logging into PWM.  If an eDirectory challenge set is applied to the user, PWM \
will use that policy, otherwise PWM will use the PWM configured challenge questions \
for forgotten password.\
\
To use only NMAS configured challenge sets, be sure to blank out the pwm required \
and forgotten questions, or else those will be used in cases where no eDirectory policy \
is found or the is an error reading the policy.

LABEL_ldap.edirectory.storeNmasResponses=Store NMAS Responses
DEFLT_ldap.edirectory.storeNmasResponses=true
DESCR_ldap.edirectory.storeNmasResponses=If true, PWM will save responses to the NMAS response storage container on the user.  This \
storage is in addition to the normal PWM response storage method.  PWM will not use these \
stored responses during forgotten password recovery.

#*******************************************************************************************#
CATEGORY_LABEL_INTRUDER=Intruder Detection
CATEGORY_DESCR_INTRUDER=PWM has built in intruder detection independent of what a directory \
 may provide.  Because PWM may be exposed directly to the internet, this additional \
 layer of detection helps protect against direct attacks.  PWM will always deny a \
 password based authentication if the directory's intruder detection is enabled. \
 <p/>\
 PWM's own intruder detection mechanisms are only stored in memory, and are not resetable, \
 thus, the timeouts should be relatively short.  The goal for PWM intruder detection isn't \
 to watch for human intruders, it is designed to stop robot or automatic attacks.\

DEFLT_intruder.user.resetTime=300
DESCR_intruder.user.resetTime=This setting defines the time period after which a bad attempt will be cleared from \
 the lockout table.  The user lockout table is marked for a user anytime a user has \
 a failed attempt to authenticate, recover a password, or activate a user account. \
 <p/>\
 Value is in number of seconds.  A value of zero disables the user lockout table. \

LABEL_intruder.user.maxAttempts=User Maximum Attempts
DEFLT_intruder.user.maxAttempts=10
DESCR_intruder.user.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts a user may make within the reset time interval.  Once \
 this value is exceeded, the user will not be able to perform any PWM activities until \
 the reset time interval has passed.

LABEL_intruder.address.resetTime=Address Reset Time
DEFLT_intruder.address.resetTime=120
DESCR_intruder.address.resetTime=This setting defines the time period after which a bad attempt will be cleared from \
 the lockout table.  The address lockout table is marked for any source ip address \
 anytime any user has a failed attempt to authenticate, recover a password, or activate \
 a user account from that address.\
 <p/>\
 Depending on how PWM is deployed it may not be able to correctly identify the IP address \
 of the user.  You can check if it is getting the correct IP address by looking at \
 the light text on the bottom of every screen, or by looking at the PWM logs.\
 <p/>\
 Some scenarios where PWM would not get the correct address is where it is behind \
 a reverse proxy that doesn't set the X-Forwarded-For header, or behind some types \
 of NAT firewalls.\
 <p/>\
 Value is in number of seconds.  A value of zero disables the address lockout table.
LABEL_intruder.address.maxAttempts=Address Maximum Attempts
DEFLT_intruder.address.maxAttempts=30
DESCR_intruder.address.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts any user may make within a particular address.  Once \
 this value is exceeded, no user from that address will be able to perform any PWM \
 activities until the reset time interval has passed.\

DESCR_intruder.session.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts any user may make during a particular browser session. \

LABEL_captcha.skip.param=Captcha Skip Parameter Value
DEFLT_captcha.skip.param=
DESCR_captcha.skip.param=Allows for skipping the captcha request if a known parameter is passed as a request \
 paramater with a key of "skipCaptcha".   This is useful for "internal" clients / links where the captcha is unneccessary.\
 <p/>\
 For example, if the value is 'okay', a request to:\
 <p/>\
 <i>https://pwmserver.example.com/pwm/public/ForgottenPassword?skipCaptcha=okay</i>\
 <p/>\
 would cause PWM to skip the captcha check.\

LABEL_captcha.skip.cookie=Captcha Skip Cookie
DEFLT_captcha.skip.cookie=instanceID
DESCR_captcha.skip.cookie=Allows for skipping the captcha request if a known browser cookie value is held by the \
 browser the cookie is stored in a cookie named 'pwm-captcha-key'.  If the value is correct,\
 then the captcha check is skipped.  The cookie value is stored in the browser after a \
 successful captcha check.\
 <p/>\
 If blank, then no cookie will be read/stored.  If set to 'instanceID', then the instanceID \
 of pwm (see web.xml instanceID setting) will be used.  If set to any other value, then \
 the literal value will be used.\
