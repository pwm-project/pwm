Setting_Description_activateUser.queryMatch=Only allow users who match this query to be activated.  Generally, you will only allow users who have never been authenticated and are not disabled to activate.  The default example uses the last login time attribute(s) on the user object to determine if the user has never logged in.  It is the responsibility of the administrator to ensure this activation feature works correctly.  Misconfiguration could potentially result in unintended activations being able to take place.
Setting_Description_activateUser.searchFilter=LDAP search filter used to search for users during user activation. &nbsp;The LDAP search filter should include each attribute in the <i>Activate User Form</i>.  Tokens made of a form item name (such as <code>cn</code>) enclosed with a percent sign <code>%cn%</code> will be replaced with values supplied by the user.<br><br>For example, if the <i>Activate User Form</i> included the attributes <code>cn</code> and <code>sn</code>, then this filter may be appropriate\:<br><br><code>(&amp;(objectClass\=person)(cn\=%cn%)(sn\=%sn%))</code><br><br>Any attributes that are listed in the form but are not used in the search filter will tested by performing an LDAP compare operation with the user supplied value.<br><br>If this setting is left blank, a search filter based on the required items in the <i>Activate User Search Form</i> will be automatically generated.
Setting_Description_activateUser.token.sendMethod=Set the method(s) used for sending the token code to the user.

Setting_Description_email.sendpassword=Email sent during forgotten password reset process if send password functionality is enabled.
Setting_Description_email.sendUsername=Email sent (if configured) for forgotten username process.
Setting_Description_email.smtp.address=Any emails generated by will be sent via this server.  Removing this setting will prevent sending any email at all.  Be sure the server listed here allows relaying.  For best results, use a local smtp server.
Setting_Description_email.smtp.advancedSettings=Name/Value settings to control the behavior of the mail agent.Available settings are defined as part of the <a href\="https\://javamail.java.net/nonav/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html">JavaMail API</a>. The settings must be in "name\=value" format, where name is the key value of a valid JavaMail API setting.

Setting_Description_email.updateguest=Email sent to updated guest users.
Setting_Description_email.updateProfile=Email sent to users after a profile update.
Setting_Description_email.userMailAttribute=User LDAP attribute containing the user's email address.
Setting_Description_enableSessionVerification=If enabled, browser sessions will be verified using an HTTP redirect and verification code.  This verification proves that the browser can correctly establish a session with the server.  Verification proves the browser either supports cookies or URL sessions (if enabled) and the communication channel between browser and application server is 'sticky' when their are multiple server instances.  Additionally it helps prevent some types of XSS attacks.<br/><br/>The pre-load browser cache will show a "please wait" screen to the user during the verification.  This has the added benefit that many of the HTTP resources (javascript, css, images, etc) will be "pre-cached" by the browser before any actual pages are loaded.
Setting_Description_events.alert.dailySummary.enable=If true, send an email alert once a day (at 0\:00 GMT) summary of the day's statistics and health.
Setting_Description_events.audit.maxAge=Maximum age (in seconds) of the local audit event log.  Default is 30 days.

Setting_Description_events.java.log4jconfigFile=Location and name of a log4j xml configuration file.  If specified, this file will be used to configure the log4j system.  If unspecified, the application logging will be configured according to the settings here any and configuration file will be ignored. The location specified by this setting is relative to the <i>WEB-INF</i> directory.  An example <i>log4jconfig-sample.xml</i> file is included in the <i>WEB-INF</i> directory.
Setting_Description_events.java.stdoutLevel=Default Log level for stdout.  Most servlet containers will redirect stdout to a log file.  For example, tomcat logs stdout output to the <i>tomcat/logs/catalina.out</i> file by default.

Setting_Description_events.ldap.maxEvents=Maximum number of events to hold in the event history attribute for a user.
Setting_Description_events.pwmDB.logLevel=Level at which to log events in the LocalDB.  Log events written to the LocalDB can be viewed in the administrator event log viewer.
Setting_Description_events.pwmDB.maxAge=Maximum age of events stored in LocalDB. <br/><br/>This setting does not effect log files configured in log4jconfig.xml or tomcat's log file settings.<br/><br/>Events older than the configured value here will be periodically purged.  Value is specified in seconds.  Default is 4 weeks (60s * 60m * 24h * 7d * 4w \= 2419200).  A value of zero will cause events not to be removed due to age.
Setting_Description_events.pwmDB.maxEvents=Maximum log events stored in LocalDB.  This number of events will be retained in the LocalDB database and use these to display in the admin event log screen.<br/><br/>This setting does not effect the normal log files configured in log4jconfig.xml or tomcat's log file settings.<br/><br/>Approximately 100MB of disk space will be consumed for each 100,000 log events.
Setting_Description_events.user.eventList=Event types to store on user-specific audit history.
Setting_Description_events.user.storageMethod=Data store used for user-specific audit history.  If using LDAP, this number should be kept small to avoid an unreasonably lengthy LDAP attribute value size.
Setting_Description_expireCheckDuringAuth=When the user is authenticated, should there be a check to see if the user's password is expired (or about to expire based on the expirePreTime).  If this is set to true, and the user's password is expired, they will be forced to the expire password page.
Setting_Description_expirePreTime=Number of seconds before a user's password expires in which to force the user to change their password.  If the user's password will expire within this time frame, the system will behave as if the user's password has already expired. <br/><br/>Setting this value to a day or so will prevent most cases of a user's password expiring while they are logged in.  The recommend setting for this value is 86400 (1 day).
Setting_Description_expireWarnTime=Number of seconds before a user's password expires in which to warn the user to change their password.  If the user's password will expire within this time frame, the system will warn the user during a CommandServlet checkExpire or checkAll operation. <br/><br/>If this time is zero or less than the expirePreTime, this feature will be disabled.  The recommended setting for this value is 432000 (5 days).
Setting_Description_external.destToken.urls=This RESTful client API is provided to allow flexibility in reading of destination token addresses and how they are displayed to the user.<br/><br/>When this setting is populated with a valid URL, just before a token is sent to a user, an HTTP POST request will be made.

Only define multiple profiles if different helpdesk users will need different features/permissions.  Each helpdesk profile has a <i>Helpdesk Profile Match</i> setting used to define to whom the profile applies.  If multiple profiles could apply for a user, the first profile in the list defined here will be assigned.
Setting_Description_helpdesk.queryMatch=This setting is used to define the set of users for which this policy applies.
Setting_Description_helpdesk.result.form=Field(s) to be shown as a result to searches.

Setting_Description_intruder.address.checkTime=The maximum time period between each intruder attempt.  When this time period is exceeded, the intruder attempt count will be reset to zero.  A value of zero disables the address lockout functionality.
Setting_Description_intruder.address.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts any user may make within a particular address.  Once this value is exceeded, no user from that address will be able to perform any activities until the reset time interval has passed.  A value of zero disables the address lockout functionality.
Setting_Description_intruder.address.resetTime=This setting defines the time period after which a bad attempt will be cleared from the lockout table.  The address lockout table is marked for any source ip address anytime any user has a failed attempt to authenticate, recover a password, or activate a user account from that address.<br/><br/>Depending on how the application is deployed it may not be able to correctly identify the IP address of the user.<br/><br/>Value is in number of seconds.  A value of zero disables the address lockout functionality.
Setting_Description_intruder.attribute.checkTime=The maximum time period between each intruder attempt.  When this time period is exceeded, the intruder attempt count will be reset to zero.
Setting_Description_intruder.attribute.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts a user may make before a lockout occurs.  Once this value is exceeded, the user will not be able to perform any activities until the reset time interval has passed.   A value of zero disables the user lockout functionality.
Setting_Description_intruder.attribute.resetTime=This setting defines the time period after which a bad attempt will be cleared from the lockout table.  The attribute lockout table is marked for a user anytime a non-authenticated user has enter a form field.  <br/><br/>Value is in number of seconds.  A value of zero disables the attribute lockout functionality.
Setting_Description_intruder.enable=Enable the application level intruder detection system.  Your LDAP directory intruder detection settings will function independently of this setting.
Setting_Description_intruder.session.maxAttempts=The maximum amount of intruder attempts per session.  When this limit is exceeded, the session will be "locked", and no other requests using that session will succeed.  A value of zero disables the session lockout functionality.
Setting_Description_intruder.storageMethod=Data store used for Intruder Records.  If <i>Database</i> is used, all application instances will share a common view of intruder status.  If <i>LocalDB</i> is used, each instance has it's own intruder state.  LocalDB is likely to have less performance overhead and having a consistent intruder state across all application instances may not be important.  Auto Configure will use a database if configured, if not the LocalDB will be used.
Setting_Description_intruder.tokenDest.checkTime=The maximum time period between each intruder attempt.  When this time period is exceeded, the intruder attempt count will be reset to zero.
Setting_Description_intruder.tokenDest.maxAttempts=The maximum number of attempts a user may make before a lockout occurs.  Once this value is exceeded, the user will not be able to perform any activities until the reset time interval has passed.   A value of zero disables the user lockout functionality.
Setting_Description_intruder.tokenDest.resetTime=This setting defines the time period after which a bad attempt will be cleared from the lockout table.  The attribute lockout table is marked for a user anytime a token is sent, and it is cleared when a token is consumed.  <br/><br/>Value is in number of seconds.  A value of zero disables the attribute lockout functionality.

The user lockout table is marked for a user anytime a user has a failed attempt to authenticate, recover a password, or activate a user account. <br/><br/>Value is in number of seconds.  A value of zero disables the user lockout functionality.
Setting_Description_knownLocales=List of locales available.  The code is in two parts separated by two colons (<code>\:\:</code>).  The first part is the browser locale code, the second field is the iso country code used for the flag value.
Setting_Description_ldap.ad.allowAuth.expired=Active Directory will fail an ldap login attempt when the current date is after the user's password expiration date.  If this option is enabled, the system will allow login even though the ldap bind has failed.  The user will only be able to set a new password when this condition occurs.  No other functions will be available until the password has been set (and this flag is cleared).
Setting_Description_ldap.ad.allowAuth.requireNewPassword=Active Directory will fail an ldap login attempt when the user's "must change password on next login" flag is set.  If this option is enabled, the system will allow login even though the ldap bind has failed.  The user will only be able to set a new password when this condition occurs.  No other functions will be available until the password has been set (and this flag is cleared).
Setting_Description_ldap.addObjectClasses=Object classes to automatically add to users who authenticate to the password servlet.  Typically this is an auxillary ldap class that contains attributes used by to store password self service data.
Setting_Description_ldap.ad.enforcePwHistoryOnSet=Enforce password policy during forgotten password when <i>Use Proxy When Password Forgotten</i> is also set to true.  This setting requires that the AD servers be at <b>Windows 2008 Server R2 SP1 or later</b>.  More specifically, it requires that the AD servers support the LDAP_SERVER_POLICY_HINTS_OID (1.2.840.113556.1.4.2066) LDAP modification control.
Setting_Description_ldap.ad.proxyForgotten=If true, when the user's password is forgotten, the system will use the ldap proxy account for ldap work.  This is because an ldap connection is not possible to AD without the user's password.  When authenticated in this condition, the user will be forced to change password immediately.
Setting_Description_ldap.defaultObjectClasses=Object class(es) of user entries in your LDAP directory.
Setting_Description_ldap.duplicateMode=Control how the application will handle the situation when multiple user matches are found for a search, such as during authentication.

Setting_Description_ldap.edirectory.cr.minRandomDuringSetup=Set the number of random questions required to be completed at the time of saving of challenge/response answers.
Setting_Description_ldap.edirectory.enableNmas=When connecting to a NetIQ eDirectory LDAP directory, this parameter will control if NMAS extensions will be used when connecting to the ldap directory.  Enabling nmas results in\:<ul><li>better error messages when using universal password policies</li><li>better error handling during certain change password scenarios</li></ul>Unless you are using an older version of eDirectory (pre 8.8 or before), it is generally best to set this to true.<br/><br/>All NMAS operations require an SSL connection to the directory.
Setting_Description_ldap.edirectory.readChallengeSets=If enabled, the challenge set configuration from eDirectory Universal Password policy will be read and applied to users.  If an eDirectory challenge set is applied to the user, that policy will be used, otherwise the policy that is a part of this configuration will be used.  To require only NMAS configured challenge sets, be sure to blank out the required and forgotten questions as part of this configuration, or else those will be used in cases where no eDirectory policy are defined.
Setting_Description_ldap.edirectory.readUserPwd=If true, the user's password will be read from eDirectory before changing it.  This prevents an extra password change from being set to a temporary random password during forgotten password sequence.  If the proxy user does not have rights to read the password, then a temporary random password will be generated for the user anyway.
Setting_Description_ldap.edirectory.storeNmasResponses=If true, user responses will be saved to the NMAS response storage container on the user.  This storage is in addition to any other configured response storage methods.
Setting_Description_ldap.edirectory.useNmasResponses=If true, NMAS stored responses will be used for forgotten password recovery.  All other configured storage methods will be tried before the NMAS stored responses will be evaluated.
Setting_Description_ldap.edirectory.ws.pwdMgtURL=If supplied, this setting will change the behavior of the forgotten password function. Instead of using the normal mechanism to read the responses stored in ldap, the NetIQ UserApp forgotten password web service will be used to discover the user's stored questions and test the user's responses.  If the forgotten password web service indicates success, then the user will be forwared to the change password screen which operates through LDAP.  The web services's "processChgPwd" method will not be used and instead the user's new password will be set via ldap.<br/><br/><i>Example\:</i> https\://10.1.1.1\:8443/IDM/pwdmgt/service<br/><br/><b>Note\:</b> A secure (https) URL should be used for security reasons.  You may need to import the HTTPS certificate into the java keystore.<br/><b>Note\:</b> The UserApp Password SOAP service only exists in NetIQ UserApp v3.7 or greater.
Setting_Description_ldap.followReferrals=Follow LDAP Referrals
Setting_Description_ldap.group.label.attribute=Display value for group entries.  Can include LDAP macros; LDAP macros will resolve to the group entry object.
Setting_Description_ldap.guidAttribute=This attribute is used to identity and reference unique users in the LDAP directory.  If set to the default value of <i>VENDORGUID</i>, the system will attempt to read the vendor specific ldap GUID.  Alternatively, you can set any string readable attribute as the GUID as long as the directory can be trusted to enforce the uniqueness.  Lastly, you can use a custom attribute, and configure the "Auto Add GUID Value" option to true.  The application defined schema includes the attribute <code>pwmGUID</code> for this usage.
Setting_Description_ldap.guid.autoAddValue=If true, A unique GUID value will be created and assigned for any user attempting to authenticate that does not have a value.  The value will be written to the attribute named in the LDAP GUID Attribute setting.
Setting_Description_ldap.idleTimeout=Amount of seconds the LDAP connection for a given session can remain idle before closing. If zero, then an ldap connection will be maintained throughout the lifetime of the http session.
Setting_Description_ldap.ignoreUnreachableProfiles=When multiple LDAP profiles exist, ignore unreachable profiles.  A Directory Unavailable error will only be shown during a user search when there is only a single LDAP Profile configured or all LDAP Profiles are unreachable.
Setting_Description_ldap.namingAttribute=Attribute name used as the naming attribute on ldap user entries. This value is also the first part of the distinguished name of a user.  This name is constant depending on directory vendor type, even if a different attribute is used for the login search filter.  Typically the naming attribute is <i>cn</i> or <i>uid</i>.
Setting_Description_ldap.oracleDS.allowAuth.requireNewPassword=Oracle Directory Server will normally fail an ldap login attempt when the user's <i>pwdReset</i> attribute is set due to an administrator password set.  If this option is enabled, the system will allow login even though the ldap bind has failed.  The user will only be able to set a new password when this condition occurs.  No other functions will be available until the password has been set (and this flag is cleared).
Setting_Description_ldap.oracleDS.enable.manipAllowChangeTime=If enabled, during the forgotten password recovery sequence, allow manipulation of the allowPasswordChangeTime attribute.  This allows forgotten password functionality with expected behavior when a policy of minimum time between password changes is enforced.
Setting_Description_ldap.profile.displayName=Display name used for this LDAP Profile.
Setting_Description_ldap.profile.enabled=Indicate if this ldap profile should be in use.  For maintenance reasons, it may be helpful to remove an LDAP Profile from use instead of deleting the profile's configuration entirely.
Setting_Description_ldap.profile.list=List of LDAP profiles.  Each ldap profile should define a unique LDAP data environment.  Depending on the directory type and configuration, this could mean a unique domain, forest, tree or possibly server.  Each profile can have multiple redundant servers defined, however those servers should share the same data.<br/><br/>Be careful when renaming or removing values in this list, if a profile name is removed or renamed the associated settings will be removed as well.<br/><br/>During authentication, each profile will be searched in the order listed here.
Setting_Description_ldap.proxy.password=The corresponding password of LDAP Proxy User user.
Setting_Description_ldap.proxy.username=LDAP Proxy User used to access the ldap directory. This user must have rights to browse users, and manage password attributes on the user object.<br/><br/>This value should be in LDAP distinguished name format, even if your ldap directory accepts other types of values for the bind DN.  An example of this format is <i>cn\=admin,o\=example</i> or <i>cn\=administrator,cn\=users,dc\=subdomain,dc\=domain,dc\=net</i>.<br/><br/>Generally, the proxy user needs read/browse object rights to all user objects it will manage, as well as create object rights in the new user container (if enabled).
Setting_Description_ldap.rootContexts=Base context to search for usernames during authentication and other operations.  Each context will be searched in order until a single match is found.  If multiple matches are found in a single context, a match will be considered not found.  Because each search is executed serially, avoid large numbers of contexts to improve search performance.
Setting_Description_ldap.search.timeoutSeconds=Maximum amount of seconds to wait for an LDAP search to complete.
Setting_Description_ldap.selectableContextMode=Control if the ldap context or profile is shown to the user as an option during user identification (login, forgotten password, etc).
Setting_Description_ldap.selectableContexts=This optional setting, if configured, will add another field to the form-based login screen and other user search screens.  The field will allow the user to select a specific context. This is for situations where the ldap directory that does not have unique usernames throughout the entire directory. <br/><br/>Values can further be set with both a display value and a context, separated by three colons.<br/><br/>For example\:<p><b>ou\=sf,ou\=ca,o\=example\:\:\:San Francisco</b><br/<b>ou\=lon,ou\=uk,o\=example\:\:\:London</b><br/<b>ou\=nyc,ou\=ny,o\=example\:\:\:New York</b><br/</p>
Setting_Description_ldap.serverCerts=LDAP Server Certificates.  These certificates have are stored in the configuration file and used to validate the identity of your LDAP server.
Setting_Description_ldap.serverUrls=List of ldap servers in URL format.  Each of these these servers will be used in a fail-over configuration.  The servers are used in order of appearance in this list.  If the first server is unavailable the next available server in the list will be used.  The first server will periodically be checked to see if it has become available.<ul><li>For secure SSL, use the "<i>ldaps\://servername\:636</i>" format</li><li>For plain-text servers, use "<i>ldap\://serverame\:389</i>" format (not recommended)</li></ul><p>When using secure connections, the Java virtual machine must trust the directory server, either because you have manually added the public key certificate from the tree to the Java keystore or the certificate is imported into the setting <i>LDAP Server Certificates</i>.<ul><li>Do not use a non-secure connection for anything but the most basic testing purposes (Many LDAP servers will reject password operations on non-secure connections)</li><li>Do not use a load-balancing device for LDAP high availability, instead use the built in LDAP server fail-over functionality</li><li>Do not use a DNS round-robin address</li><li>Avoid using the network address, use the proper fully-qualified domain name address for the server</li></ul>
Setting_Description_ldap.testuser.username=The LDAP test user is used to test functionality and access to the ldap directory. This user should be configured similar to a normal user account with normal access privileges. This account will periodically be used to perform a health check, including changing the password of the account. <br/><br/><b>Using a test user account will greatly increase the ability to detect and alert configuration and health issues.</b><br/><br/>The following functionality (if enabled) will be tested using the test user account.<ul><li>Authentication</li><li>Password policy reading</li><li>Set password</li><li>Set challenge/responses</li><li>Load challenge/responses</li></ul>
Setting_Description_ldap.user.group.attribute=Attribute on user entry that references group entries.  The value of this attribute in the directory must be a LDAP DN.
Setting_Description_ldap.username.attr=If blank, the LDAP Naming Attribute will be used.  This option allows fields that display or store the <i>Username</i> or <i>UserID</i> of a user to show something other then the LDAP Naming Attribute if appropriate.  It is desirable that this value be unique for this system.
Setting_Description_ldap.usernameSearchFilter=Used to for contextless login and other functions to find users in ldap using usernames.  The value <i>%USERNAME%</i> is replaced with the actual username value.
Setting_Description_ldap.wireTrace.enable=If true, all ldap traffic will be output to the TRACE logging level.<br/><br/><b>WARNING\:</b> enabling this option may allow user passwords and other sensitive data to be written to the log files.
Setting_Description_locale.cookie.age=Duration of time to remember a user's locale preferences.  Anytime a browser's default locale setting is overridden, a cookie will be stored in the browser remembering that setting for the duration of this setting.
Setting_Description_logoutAfterPasswordChange=Force user to logout (and be sent to logoutURL) after a password change.<br/><br/>In most cases, this should be left on (default), especially if using some type of single sign on service.
Setting_Description_naaf.requiredMethods=Required NAAF Login Methods.  Each method selected will be required to be competed by users during the NAAF forgotten password verification sequence.  The user must have previously completed any enrollment required for the method to be used successfully.
Setting_Description_naaf.userIdentifier=User identifier to present to the NAAF web service.  NAAF identifiers are typically in the format of <code>repository\\username</code>.  User macros can be used for this setting.<br/><br/>For example, using a value of <code>IDV\\@&zwnj;LDAP\:cn@</code> would present the username using the <code>cn</code> attribute to login to a NAAF repository named <i>IDV</i>.
Setting_Description_naaf.ws.serverCerts=Certificate for the NAAF web service server.
Setting_Description_naaf.ws.url=The URL for the NAAF appliance REST web service.  Version 1 (v1) of the NAAF REST webservice is required.<br/><br/>Examples:<ul><li>https://naaf.example.com/api/v1</li><li>https://172.17.2.2/api/v1</li></ul>
Setting_Description_network.allowMultiIPSession=If true, Allow a single HTTP session to be accessed from different source IP addresses.  Some load balancing/proxy network infrastructures may require this, but in most cases it should be disabled.  Especially since typical sessions are very short, there is generally not a practical reason for a user to access the same session from multiple client addresses.
Setting_Description_network.ip.permittedRange=If specified, only connections originating from the specified IP address ranges will be permitted.  If blank (default), any source address is permitted.<p>Supported range specifications are\:<p><ul><li>Full IPv4 address, e.g. <b>12.34.56.78</b></li><li>Full IPv6 address, e.g. <b>2001\:18e8\:3\:171\:218\:8bff\:fe2a\:56a4</b></li><li>Partial IPv4 address, e.g. <b>12.34</b> (which matches any IP starting <b>12.34</b></li><li>IPv4 network/netmask, e.g. <b>18.25.0.0/255.255.0.0</b></li><li>IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR slash notation, e.g. <b>18.25.0.0/16</b> or <b>2001\:18e8\:3\:171\:\:/64</b></li></ul>
Setting_Description_network.requiredHttpHeaders=<p>Required HTTP header name and value pairs.  If specified, any HTTP request sent to the server must have these headers to be honored.  This feature is useful if you have a security gateway and wish to only allow sessions from the gateway.</p><p>The settings must be in "name\=value" format.</p>
Setting_Description_network.reverseDNS.enable=If true, the system's reverse DNS system is used to record the hostname of the client.  In some cases this can cause performance issues so it can be disabled if it is not required.
Setting_Description_newUser.createContext=LDAP context for new users to be created in.  Macros are permitted in this setting.  The Default LDAP profile will always be used for new user creation.
Setting_Description_newUser.deleteOnFail=If the new user account creation fails for some reason, delete the (potentially partially-created) "broken" account in ldap.
Setting_Description_newUser.email.verification=If true, an email will be sent to the new user's email address before the account is created.  The NewUser must verify receipt of the email before the account will be created.

Setting_Description_newUser.sms.verification=If true, an SMS will be sent to the new user's mobile phone number before the account is created.  The NewUser must verify receipt of the SMS before the account will be created.
Setting_Description_newUser.username.definition=\n        <p>This setting controls the entry id of the newly created LDAP entry.  In some directories this is often used\n        as the "username", though many directories separate the concepts and values of entry ID and username.</p>\n        <p>Values can (and usually do) include macros.  In case the first value\n        is already existing in the directory, each successive value is tried until a free value is found.  Though the user\n        is not yet created when the macros are evaluated, LDAP macros will use the data provided on the new user form.  Other\n        macros may not be useful as there no data yet available on the user.</p>\n        <p>If blank, the username must be present in the form, defined as the LDAP naming attribute value.</p>\n
Setting_Description_newUser.writeAttributes=Actions to be taken when a user is created.  These actions will be executed just after creating the object.
Setting_Description_oauth.idserver.attributesUrl=Web service provided by the identity server to return attribute data about the user.
Setting_Description_oauth.idserver.clientName=OAuth client ID.  This value will be provided by the OAuth identity service provider.

Setting_Description_oauth.idserver.loginUrl=OAuth server login URL.  This is the URL to redirect the user to for authentication.
Setting_Description_oauth.idserver.secret=OAuth shared secret.  This value will be provided by the OAuth identity service provider.
Setting_Description_oauth.idserver.serverCerts=Certificate for the OAuth web service server.
Setting_Description_otp.enabled=Set to true to enable the configuration and use of one time password.
Setting_Description_otp.forceSetup=If true and one time passwords are enabled, the user will be directed to configure a one time password secret when logging in.  The user is forced to configure one time password if they do not have a current valid secret stored.
Setting_Description_otp.secret.allowSetup.queryMatch=Permission used to determine if a user is a permitted to setup an OTP secret.
Setting_Description_otp.secret.encrypt=If enabled, the Security Key is used to encrypt and decrypt token information, to make sure it is not readable as plain text.  Multiple application instances must use the same Security Key.  If the Security Key is changed, stored OTP passwords will no longer be usable.
Setting_Description_otp.secret.identifier=User Identifier.  Macros are available.
Setting_Description_otp.secret.ldap.attribute=LDAP attribute for storing the OTP secret.  This setting is used only when the storage method is set to LDAP.

This format does not support recovery codes.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>PAM text</td><td>Store the secret, description and recovery codes in the text file format, used by the Google Authenticator PAM module.</td></tr>\n</table>
Setting_Description_otp.secret.writePreference=Location to write the OTP secret to.  All storage methods will be written to when the user configures their response answers.
Setting_Description_password.allowChange.queryMatch=Permissions used to detect if a user is a permitted to change password.
Setting_Description_password.change.requireCurrent=If true, the user's current password will be required on the change password page for most change password scenarios.  In most cases this is not required because the user just authenticated prior to the seeing the change password page.  The major exception is when using SSO, in that case you will probably what to set "Only when not expired" so that the current password must be supplied when the user attempts a password change during a session, but not when forced to change immediately upon authentication.
Setting_Description_passwordLastUpdateAttribute=This attribute is used to mark when the password is updated, and is used during replication checks, and other processes.

Setting_Description_password.policy.allowSpecial=Allow special (non alpha-numeric) characters in password.
Setting_Description_password.policy.caseSensitivity=Controls if the password is case sensitive.  In most cases, this can be read from the directory, but in some cases this value is not able to correctly read, so you may override it here.
Setting_Description_password.policy.changeMessage=Message to be displayed to user during password changes.  May include HTML markup.  This setting may be overwritten by a change password message read as part of an ldap password policy.
Setting_Description_password.policy.charGroup.minimumMatch=
Setting_Description_password.policy.charGroup.regExValues=
Setting_Description_password.policy.checkWordlist=Check the password against the configured Wordlist.

Setting_Description_password.policy.minimumStrength=Password strengths are judged on a strength on a scale of 0 to 100 irrespective of other password policy settings.  This setting requires that the user have a password that meets the minimum strength level specified here, regardless of other password policy rules.   45 or better is considered "good" while 70 or better is considered "strong".  A value of 0 disables this check.
Setting_Description_password.policy.minimumUnique=Minimum amount of unique characters allowed.  A value of zero disables this check.
Setting_Description_password.policy.minimumUpperCase=Minimum amount of uppercase characters required.  A value of zero disables this check.
Setting_Description_password.policy.queryMatch=Settings here are used to determine if this password policy applies to a given user.  During login, if a previous policy has not yet been assigned to the user, the matches here are considered and if positive, the user will then be assigned this policy.
Setting_Description_password.policy.regExMatch=A Regular Expression pattern the password must match in order to be allowed.  Multiple patterns can be listed.  A pattern must match the <i>entire</i> password to be applied.  A partial match is ignored.
Setting_Description_password.policy.regExNoMatch=A Regular Expression pattern the password must <b>not</b> match in order to be allowed.  Multiple patterns can be listed.  A pattern must match the <i>entire</i> password to be applied.  A partial match is ignored.
Setting_Description_password.policy.ruleText=When blank, an automatically generated rule list will be displayed to the user. The automated rule list may not be inclusive of all settings in the password policy. Some of the more esoteric or difficult to communicate rules will not appear in the automatically generated list.  This is done in an attempt to not overwhelm the user with having to read and parse the rules before attempting to change the password.  Should the user type a password that conflicts with such a rule - the per-keystroke rule checker will provide direct feedback to the user on how to correct the problem.<br/><br/>If the automatically generated rule list is not desired, it can be overridden by setting a value here.  HTML tags are permitted.
Setting_Description_password.policy.source=This setting determines where password policy settings should be read from.  If <code>LDAP</code> is selected, an attempt to read the policy out of the ldap directory will be made, and many of the following settings could be ignored.  If <code>Local Config</code> is selected, the policy settings on this page are used, and any policy settings in the LDAP directory are ignored.  If <code>Merge</code> is selected, both policies are read, and where there is any conflict, The application will chose the most restrictive value of the policy.<br/><br/>The capability to read policy from LDAP is only available with some LDAP directory types.  <p>Additionally, the password policy used is only the "local" policy used by this application.  Upon a password set operation, the LDAP directory will typically enforce whatever policies are configured in the directory itself.
Setting_Description_password.profile.list=List of Password Policy Profiles.  When multiple password policy profiles are configured, all profiles are evaluated in order to check if the setting <code>@PwmSettingReference\:password.policy.queryMatch@</code> matches the user.
Setting_Description_password.require.form=Values required to be entered prior to password change.
Setting_Description_password.sharedHistory.age=The maximum age of the shared history storage.  Value is specified in seconds.  Default is 28 days.
Setting_Description_password.sharedHistory.enable=Enable a global shared password history for all users.  If enabled, all users will share a common password history.  This helps prevent common organizational words from being used as passwords by users.  Passwords are stored as a salted and encrypted hash in the LocalDB.
Setting_Description_password.showAutoGen=If set to true, a link will be displayed to users during the change password process to display a list of auto-generated sample passwords that are allowed by the configured password policies.  The user will have the option to select and use one of the values in the list.  If this option feature is enabled the user is not forced to choose a password from the list.
Setting_Description_password.showStrengthMeter=If true, the user will see the password strength meter on the change password screen.
Setting_Description_passwordSync.enableReplicaCheck=Check for the password to be updated on all configured replicas (for a user's LDAP Profile).  When enabled, replica sync checking will poll all of the configured replicas on the user's LDAP Profile to determine if the password change time has been updated.  The particular method to determine the last password change time varies per LDAP vendor type.
Setting_Description_passwordSyncMaxWaitTime=During a password change, the system will wait for the password to be synchronized to all configured LDAP servers.  In cases where the synchronization may take an extraordinary amount of time, this setting will prevent the page from timing out.<br/><br/>Value is specified in seconds.
Setting_Description_passwordSyncMinWaitTime=During a password change, a delay of this amount will be waited for before forwarding the user.  This gives any background synchronization processes time to execute before the user executes the next operation.<br/><br/>Value is specified in seconds.
Setting_Description_password.wordlist.wordSize=Minimum number of characters in the password that are checked against the wordlist dictionary. For example, if the password to be checked is "wordlist" and this setting is set to 6, then the combinations "wordli", "wordlis", "wordlist", "ordlis", "ordlist" and "rdlist" would all be checked against the configured dictionary. If any of these values are equal to any word in the wordlist dictionary, then the password is considered to match the wordlist and will be rejected. If this value is set to zero or the password to check is smaller then the value specified here, then the entire password is checked against the wordlist but not any smaller parts of it.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.detail.form=Attributes to be shown during the detail view of of an individual person record.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.displayName.cardLabels=Display labels for user panel in PeopleSearch detail and on org chart views.  LDAP Attribute value such as <code>@LDAP\:givenName@</code> macros can be used.  A maximum of four values can be set.

Setting_Description_peopleSearch.enable=Enable the PeopleSearch module.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.enablePublic=
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.idleTimeout=Number of seconds after which an authenticated session becomes unauthenticated.   If the value is set to 0, then the application wide idle timeout value will be used.  If a user is using the PeopleSearch module without authenticating, then no timeout is applied.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.maxCacheSeconds=When searches and record details are read from eDirectory, the results are cached within the application for a period of time.  Use this setting to control the maximum amount of time cached data can be used.  Setting to zero will disable the cache entirely, but may negatively impact the scability of the application and/or the LDAP directory.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.orgChart.childAttribute=Attribute that contains the LDAP DN of the direct reports for a user.  If this setting is blank, the org chart view will not be shown.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.orgChart.parentAttribute=Attribute that contains the LDAP DN of the manager.  If this setting is blank, the org chart view will not be shown.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.photo.ldapAttribute=LDAP Attribute to use for photo.  Or blank, if no photo is to be displayed.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.photo.queryFilter=Permission filter to control photo visibility when displaying an org chart or detail record view.  If a user does not match this permission, the user's photo will not be displayed.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.photo.urlOverride=If user photos are not stored in LDAP, this setting can show photos from an external system.  If this setting is specified, the photo will not be loaded from the LDAP directory.<br/><br/>Example\:<code>http\://photos.example.com/employee/@LDAP\:workforceID@.jpg</code>
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.queryMatch=Define the users permitted to access the PeopleSearch module.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.result.form=Attributes to be shown in the search results table during searches.

Setting_Description_peopleSearch.searchAttributes=List of LDAP attributes to search the when generating an automatic search filter for the setting <a data-gotoSettingLink\="peopleSearch.searchFilter">@PwmSettingReference\:peopleSearch.searchFilter@</a>.  Also used to determine which fields in the user detail form will show the "Like" search option.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.searchBase=If empty, the default ldap search base(s) will be used.
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.searchFilter=LDAP search filter to query the directory with.  Substitute <i>%USERNAME%</i> for user supplied username.  If blank, the search filter will be auto generated based on the values in the setting <a data-gotoSettingLink\="peopleSearch.searchAttributes">@PwmSettingReference\:peopleSearch.searchAttributes@</a>.\n        <br/><br>\n        Example\: <code>(&(objectClass\=Person)(|(givenName\=*%USERNAME%*)(sn\=*%USERNAME%*)(mail\=*%USERNAME%*)(telephoneNumber\=*%USERNAME%*)))</code>\n\n
Setting_Description_peopleSearch.useProxy=Use LDAP proxy account to perform searches.  For proper security in most environments this setting should <b>not</b> be enabled.
Setting_Description_pwmAdmin.queryMatch=Permissions used to determine if a user will be granted administrator rights.
Setting_Description_pwm.appProperty.overrides=Override application properties.  Do not use unless directed to by a support expert.
Setting_Description_pwmDb.location=Location of the LocalDB directory. If the specified path is relative, the path will be considered relative to the servlet's <i>WEB-INF</i> directory.
Setting_Description_pwm.forwardURL=After completing any activity which does not require a logout, the user will be forwarded to this url.<br/><br/>This setting can always be overridden for any given user session by adding a <i>forwardURL</i> parameter to any HTTP request.  If blank, the user will be forward to the application menu.
Setting_Description_pwm.homeURL=The URL to redirect user to upon clicking the home button.  If blank, the home button will return the user to the application context URL.
Setting_Description_pwmInstanceName=Name of this application instance.  If blank a persistent, randomly generated value will be used.  Recommended value is blank.
Setting_Description_pwm.logoutURL=URL to redirect user to upon logout.  If the site is being accessed through a web authentication gateway, the Logout URL should be set to the gateway's Logout URL. If you are using a gateway and do not include the proper logout URL here, then users will almost certainly get authentication errors, intruder lockouts and other problems.  If things are working properly then the user should see the gateway logout screen when logging out.<br/><br/>The Logout URL can be set to any desired relative or absolute URL.  At the time the user's browser requests this url, the local session will have already been invalidated.<br/><br/>This setting can always be overridden for any given user session by adding a <i>logoutURL</i> parameter to any HTTP request during the session.
Setting_Description_pwm.publishStats.enable=If true, the statistics of this application are periodically published statics to the project website.   The published statistics are\:<ul><li>Instance Name</li><li>Version/Build Information</li><li>Cumulative Statistics</li><li>Which settings are non default (but not the actual setting values</li></ul>Leaving this feature enabled helps developers know which features are used by administrators.
Setting_Description_pwm.publishStats.siteDescription=If Anonymous statistics publishing is enabled, this optional site description is published along with the otherwise anonymous statistics.  This can be an organization name, or other similar value.
Setting_Description_pwm.requireHTTPS=Require HTTPS (instead of cleartext HTTP) traffic to the application server.  While non-secure connections are useful during testing, production servers should always have this setting set to true.
Setting_Description_pwm.securityKey=<p>A Security Key used for cryptographic functions such as the token verification. A value is required if tokens are enabled for any of modules and a token storage method has been configured. This value is used similar to how the private key in a cryptographic security certificate is used.</p> <p>If configured, this value must be at least 32 characters in length.  The longer and more random this value, the more secure its use will be.  If multiple instances are in use, each instance should be configured with the same value.</p><p>Upon initial setup, a random security key is assigned to this value, it can be changed at any time, however any outstanding tokens or other material generated by an old security key will become invalid.</p>
Setting_Description_pwm.seedlist.location=When passwords are randomly generated, the system can generate "friendly" random password suggestions to users.  It does this by using a "seed" word or words, and then modifying that word randomly until it is sufficiently complex and meets the configured rules computed for the user.<br/><br/>Setting this to blank will result in suggested passwords being completely randomized.
Setting_Description_pwm.selfURL=The URL to this application, as seen by users.  The value is used in email macros and other user facing communications.  Example\: <b>http\://www.example.com/password</b>.  The site URL must use a valid fully qualified hostname.  Do not use a network address.
Setting_Description_pwm.versionCheck.enable=Allow periodically checks for new versions.  If a new version is detected, an item will be shown on the health check.
Setting_Description_pwm.wordlist.location=Specify a word list for dictionary checking to prevent users from using commonly used words as passwords.   Using wordists is an important part of password security.  Wordlists are used by intruders to guess common passwords.   The default wordlist included contains commonly used English passwords.  More comprehensive wordlists are available.  <br/><br/>The first time a startup occurs with a new wordlist setting, it will take some time to compile the wordlist into a database.  See the status screen/logs for progress information.  The wordlist file format is one or more text files containing a single word per line, enclosed in a ZIP file.  The String <i>\!\#comment\:</i> at the beginning of a line indicates a comment.  If a full path is not specified, the applications <i>WEB-INF</i> directory is assumed.
Setting_Description_recovery.action=Action to take when the user completes the forgotten password process.
Setting_Description_recovery.allowWhenLocked=Allow user to use the forgotten password feature when the account is intruder locked in LDAP.  This feature is not available when a user is using NMAS stored responses.
Setting_Description_recovery.enable=If enabled, forgotten password recovery will be available to users.
Setting_Description_recovery.form=Form fields for activate user module.  Each attribute will be required to be entered by the user.  Ideally, the user will be required to enter some personal data that is not publicly known.
Setting_Description_recovery.postActions=Actions to execute after a user has successfully completed the forgotten password sequence and the user's password has been modified.  Macros may be used.
Setting_Description_recovery.profile.list=A list of forgotten password policies.  This list is evaluated in the order shown here.  The first profile in the list to match on the setting <code>@PwmSettingReference\:recovery.queryMatch@</code> will be applied to a user.<br/><br/>Unless you need to define different forgotten password behavior for different users, you do not need to change this list from the default.
Setting_Description_recovery.queryMatch=This setting defines the set of users that this profile will be assigned to.
Setting_Description_recovery.require.otp=If enabled, a one time password will be required during the forgotten password process.  The user will be required to type the generated token in order to proceed to recover their password.  If this setting is disabled, then at least one other recovery method must be set to true for forgotten password recovery to operate.
Setting_Description_recovery.response.readPreference=Location to read the responses from. If an option with multiple values are selected, each location will be read in turn until a stored response is found.
Setting_Description_recovery.response.writePreference=<p>Location to write the responses to.  All storage methods will be written to when the user configures their response answers.</p><p><b>WARNING\: </b>The LocalDB should never be used to store responses in a production system as there are no methods to make the LocalDB storage redundant, nor are optimal backup methods available for the LocalDB.</p>
Setting_Description_recovery.searchFilter=LDAP search filter used to search for users during forgotten password recovery. &nbsp;The LDAP search filter should include each attribute in the <i>Forgotten Password User Search Form</i>.  Tokens made of a form item name (such as <code>cn</code>) enclosed with a percent sign <code>%cn%</code> will be replaced with values supplied by the user.<br><br>For example, if the <i>Activate User Form</i> included the attributes <code>cn</code> and <code>sn</code>, then this filter may be appropriate\:<br><br><code>(&amp;(objectClass\=person)(cn\=%cn%)(sn\=%sn%))</code><br><br>If this setting is left blank, a search filter based on the required items in the <i>Forgotten Password User Search Form</i> will be automatically generated.
Setting_Description_recovery.sendNewPassword.sendMethod=Method to send new password to user when the <i>Forgotten Password Success Action</i> is set to <i>Send new password</i>
Setting_Description_recovery.verificationMethods=Verification methods to be used during forgotten password.  The user must satisfy each option marked required.  The user can then select any of the remaining optional methods until the minimum number of optional methods have been completed.
Setting_Description_reporting.enable=Enable directory reporting.  When enabled, a local cache of user data will be maintained and will be made available to the administrator.  Enabling this option will require additional disk space and possibly Java heap memory, so it should be tested on a test server before enabling in a production environment.
Setting_Description_reporting.job.timeOffset=Number of seconds past midnight (GMT) when the update job is processed.  Setting to -1 will disable the nightly job processor.
Setting_Description_reporting.ldap.maxQuerySize=Maximum number of records read during a reporting query search.  Setting this value to larger sizes will require more Java heap memory.
Setting_Description_reporting.ldap.searchFilter=LDAP search filter to be used when running a reporting job.  If blank a filter based on the login query setting will be auto-generated.
Setting_Description_reporting.maxCacheAge=Maximum age of a cached report record before it is discarded.  Records older than this age will be periodically purged from the local report data cache.  This is done so that records that are deleted from the LDAP directory will eventually be removed from the report cache.  The default value of 2592000 seconds is equal to 30 days.<br/><br/>Value is specified in seconds.
Setting_Description_reporting.minCacheAge=Minimum cache age of a cached report record before it will be re-read by the application.  For example, setting this value to one day (86400) would mean that a given cached report record would only be read once every day, regardless of how often the report is run.  This also means that the average record in the report would be approximately one day out of date.<br/><br/>Value is specified in seconds.
Setting_Description_reporting.reportRestTimeMS=Milliseconds.  Time between each user read interval.  Having this rest interval will prevent slow performing systems from being overloaded when the report engine runs.  If the default of value of <i>-1</i> is used, the system will compute a value that will result in roughly a 50% slowdown in speed.  A value of zero will result in the report process running as quickly as possible but user performance may suffer.
Setting_Description_reporting.summary.dayValues=Day intervals to include in report summary data
Setting_Description_response.hashMethod=<p>The method of Hashing used to store responses.  Storing the responses as plaintext may facilitate synchronization or migration to other systems.</p><p>This setting only controls the writing of the responses.  Stored responses in other formats can always be read.
Setting_Description_security.cspHeader=Set the HTTP Content-Security-Policy header.  This header instructs the browser to limit the locations from which it will load fonts, scripts and css files.
Setting_Description_security.formNonce.enable=Require a nonce (or unique key) for each form to prevent certain types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Setting_Description_security.ldap.simulateBadPassword=This feature will enable Bad Password simulation activity when a forgotten password field is entered.  When an identified user attempts to recover a forgotten password but uses incorrect data, the application will attempt to authenticate to the directory using a known bad password value.  This is done to allow the ldap directory to trigger it's own defense mechanisms against intruders.
Setting_Description_security.page.enableRequestSequence=Enable detection of the use of back button or other browser navigation irregularities.  Enabling this option prevents duplicate HTTP form submissions but can sometimes have side effects.
Setting_Description_security.page.leaveNoticeTimeout=When a user navigates away from any page, a notice is sent to the server.   The next time a page is requested, the timeout is checked to determine if the last page leave time was greater then the timeout, and if so, the user's session will be invalidated.  This has the effect of logging out users that navigate away from the application without explicitly logging out.If set to zero, this feature is disabled.
Setting_Description_security.preventFraming=When enabled, prevent this application from being displayed inside an IFrame.  This is done by setting the <i>X-Frame-Options</i> HTTP Header to <i>DENY</i> on all pages.
Setting_Description_security.redirectUrl.whiteList=A list of partial URL fragments.  Any attempt to set the forwardURL or logoutURL via request parameter\n        must match a URL fragment listed here.\n        <ul>\n          <li>Each item will be attempted to be matched from the <b>beginning</b> of the requested URL string.</li>\n          <li>The redirect URL is decoded and parsed before checked against the whitelist.</li>\n          <li>If an error occurs when setting a redirect URL, set the debug logs to TRACE and watch the output as the error occurs.</li>\n          <li>Wildcards or case mis-matches are not permitted, the values must match exactly.</li>\n          <li>If a fragment has the prefix <i>regex\:</i>, the remainder of the fragment is treated as a regular expression.  Regular expression matches must match the entire URL.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <table>\n        <tr><td>Example</td><td>Matches</td><td>Not Matched</td></tr>\n        <td>https\://www.example.com</td><td>https\://www.example.com<br/>https\://www.example.com/<br/>https\://www.example.com/path</td><td>http\://www.example.com<br/>https\://mail.example.com</td></tr>\n        <td>http\://www.example.com/p1</td><td>http\://www.example.com/p1<br/>http\://www.example.com/p1/p2<br/>http\://www.example.com/p1?a1\=v1</td><td>https\://www.example.com/p1<br/>http\://www.example.com/p2</td></tr>\n        <td>/path1</td><td>/path1<br/>/path1/path2<br/>/path1/path2/?param\=v1</td><td>www.example.com/path1/<br/>https\://www.example.com/path1<br/>/path2</td></tr>\n        <td>regex\:^(https?\:\\/\\/)[a-z]*\\.example\\.com.*?$</td><td>http\://www.example.com<br/>https\://www.example.com<br/>http\://www.example.com/p1<br/>http\://mail.example.com/p1</td><td>www.example.com<br/>http\://www.example.org</td></tr>\n        </table>\n
Setting_Description_security.sso.authHeaderName=With this setting enabled, an upstream server can be configured to allow autologin with a only a username, a password is not required.  This setting controls the name of the HTTP header.  When used, a user will likely be prompted for their password to access certain functionality.
Setting_Description_session.maxSeconds=Maximum duration of a session (in seconds).  Having a maximum session lifetime prevents certain types of long-term session fixation attacks.
Setting_Description_shortcut.enable=Enable the shortcuts module.
Setting_Description_shortcut.httpHeaders=HTTP Headers to use to control the visible list of shortcuts.  If this header is present, these values will be used to determine which of the configured shortcuts are available to a user.
